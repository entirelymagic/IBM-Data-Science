## Fundamentals of Data Science.

### What is Data Science?

> Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make 
> strategic choices. \
> There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, 
> and a lot of curiosity about data. \
> New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative. \
> Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century, paying high salaries for skilled workers.


> The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on. \
> Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. \
> Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate 
> easily.

### Foundations of Big Data

> #### The V's of Big Data:
> - Velocity 
>   - speed of witch data is accumulated
> - Volume 
>   - scale of the data \ volume of data stored
> - Variety 
>   - diversity of the data
> - Veracity 
>   - quality and origin of data
>   - attributes:
>       - consistency;
>       - completeness;
>       - integrity;
>       - ambiguity;
> - Value 
>   - ability and need to turn data into value.


#### Getting Started with Data Science

> Establish Data Mining Goals   
> Selecting Data    
> Preprocessing Data     
> Transforming Data     
> Storing Data      
> Mining Data       
> Evaluating Mining results

> Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that simulates human decision-making using neural networks.    
> Machine Learning has many applications, from recommender systems that provide relevant choices for customers on 
> commercial websites, to detailed analysis of financial markets.

> Data Science helps physicians provide the best treatment for their patients, and helps meteorologists predict the 
> extent of local weather events, and can even help predict natural disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes.
>
> The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from 
> the data analysis to key decision-makers.
